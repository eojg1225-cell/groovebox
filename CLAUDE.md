# Groovebox

Web-first groovebox (techno, DnB, dub, jungle). Full spec: `groovebox-brief.md` (read it first).

## Rules
- Work milestone by milestone (section 12 of the brief); keep the build green; commit after each working step.
- `src/engine`, `src/instruments`, `src/fx` must stay free of DOM and Web Audio code.
- Audio thread: no allocation per block, no console.log, no blocking.
- Keep sound design basic at first; clean interfaces for refining later.
- Must work in desktop Chrome/Edge and Silk on a Fire tablet (touch, multi-touch).

## Current milestone
M0: Skeleton (Vite + TypeScript, tap-to-start, AudioWorklet test tone, pixel canvas, touch panel with a few knobs, static deploy).

## Build / deploy
To be filled in during M0.
